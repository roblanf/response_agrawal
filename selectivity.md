# A comment on selectivity versus open access

Point 4 in the article says this: 

"when a hiring committee examines a junior scientist’s CV, a publication in a traditional journal carries with it the weight associated with the journal’s reputation for selectivity, rigor, novelty, and yes, likely impact. On the surface, a publication in an open-access journal only imparts ‘not scientifically flawed"

and later he says that OA journals provide "no stamp of rigor or potential impact". 


# Many open access journals highly selective

In a recent letter, Agrawal [1] outlines his opinions on open access publishing. In it, he incorrectly conflates open-access and non-selective journals. This is a common misconception, and we would like to set the record straight: many open-access journals are highly selective.

Agrawal [1] states that  "a publication in an open-access journal only imparts [the information that it is] ‘not scientifically flawed'", and later that open-access jouranls provide "no stamp of rigor or potential impact". It is certainly true that some open-access journals (most notably, PLOS ONE) do not reject papers based on novelty or percieved impact. However, many open access journals are at least as selective as traditional print journals (e.g., eLife, PLOS Biology, Table 1).

To illustrate the diversity of publishing policies in open access journals, and in particular to highight that many are highly selective, we have compiled a table of the publication policies of popular open access journals in ecology and evolution (Table 1). [NB perhaps we should get all the IFs from ISI, then score journals as open or not using the Directory of Open Access Journals, then look up the policies of as many as we can find. We can also then plot the distribution of impact factors in OA versus non-OA journals. If there are too many journals for a table in the paper, we can summarise the data as 'highly selective', 'selective', or 'not selective', and just plot the numbers].

We agree with Agrawal that researchers should carefully consider the options when deciding where to publish. The decision affects who will see the work and how it (and the researcher who produces it) will be judged. And while journal-level metrics, such as the Impact Factor (IF), have many limitations, they are a reasonable predictor of an article's merit and future citation count [2]. It therefore behooves us all to be aware of journals' publishing policies, both for our own science and in our judgement of others'. This is particularly important as the publishing landscape is changing rapidly, and hiring and granting committees are trying to keep pace.
