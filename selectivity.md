# A comment on selectivity versus open access

Point 4 in the article says this: 

"when a hiring committee examines a junior scientist’s CV, a publication in a traditional journal carries with it the weight associated with the journal’s reputation for selectivity, rigor, novelty, and yes, likely impact. On the surface, a publication in an open-access journal only imparts ‘not scientifically flawed"

and later he says that OA journals provide "no stamp of rigor or potential impact". 


# Many open access journals are highly selective

In a recent letter, Agrawal [1] outlines his opinions on open access publishing. In it, he incorrectly conflates open-access and non-selective journals. Specifically, Agrawal [1] states that  "a publication in an open-access journal only imparts [the information that it is] ‘not scientifically flawed'", and later that open-access journals provide "no stamp of rigor or potential impact". Unfortunately, it is a common misconception that open access journals are not selective, and we would like to set the record straight: many open-access journals are highly selective.

We compiled data on the publication policies of 31 popular open access journals in biology, medicine, ecology, evolution, and plant science (Table 1, full version with journal publication policies available at Figshare [2]). Our data reveal a diversity of policies in open access publishing, ranging from journals that aim to publish valid science regardless of novelty or likely impact (e.g. PLOS ONE, The PeerJ), to those that are at least as selective as the most competitive closed-access journals (e.g. PLOS Biology, BMC Biology, eLife). In total, 22 of the 30 journals in our table apply some kind of selection based on novelty and likely impact. Interestingly, many open access journals are leading their fields based on metrics such as impact factors, regardless of their selectivity. For example, the 1st and 5th ranked journals in ISI's 'Biology' category are both open access and highly selective (PLOS Biology and BMC Biology, respectively), and the 2nd journal in ISI's 'Zoology' category is open access and non-selective (Frotiers in Zoology).

We agree with Agrawal that researchers should carefully consider their options when deciding where to publish. The decision affects who will see the work, how it (and the researcher who produces it) will be judged, and the rise and fall of scientific publishing models. And while journal-level metrics such as the Impact Factor (IF) have many limitations, they can be used to estimate an article's future citation count [2]. It is therefore important that we are all aware of journals' publishing policies, both for our own science and in our judgement of others'. Having accurate information on open access journals is particularly important as hiring and granting committees try to keep pace with a rapidly changing publishing landscape. We hope that the information we have compiled will help with this [2].
