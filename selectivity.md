# A comment on selectivity versus open access

Point 4 in the article says this: 

"when a hiring committee examines a junior scientist’s CV, a publication in a traditional journal carries with it the weight associated with the journal’s reputation for selectivity, rigor, novelty, and yes, likely impact. On the surface, a publication in an open-access journal only imparts ‘not scientifically flawed"

and later he says that OA journals provide "no stamp of rigor or potential impact". 


# Many open access journals highly selective

In a recent letter, Agrawal [1] outlines his opinions on open access publishing. In it, he incorrectly conflates open-access and non-selective journals. This is a common misconception, and we would like to set the record straight: many open-access journals are highly selective.

Agrawal [1] states that  "a publication in an open-access journal only imparts [the information that it is] ‘not scientifically flawed'", and later he states that open-access jouranls provide "no stamp of rigor or potential impact". To illustrate that this is wrong, we compiled a table of the publication policies of 30 popular open access journals in biology, medicine, ecology, evolution, and plant science (Table 1, full version with journal publication policies available at Figshare [2]). 

Our data reveals a diversity of policies in open access publishing, ranging from journals that aim to publish valid science regardless of novelty or likely impact (e.g. PLoS ONE, The PeerJ), to those that are at least as selective as the most competitive closed-access journals (e.g. PLoS Biology, BMC Biology, eLife). In total, 22 of the 30 journals in our table apply some kind of selection based on novelty and likely impact. And, regardless of their selectivity, many open access journals are leading their fields based on metrics such as impact factors. For example, the 1st and 5th ranked journals in ISI's 'Biology' category are both open access and highly selective (PLoS Biology and BMC Biology, respectively). The 2nd journal in ISI's 'Zoology' category is open access and non-selective (Frotiers in Zoology).

We agree with Agrawal that deciding where to publish should not be taken lightly. The decision affects the rise and fall of science publishing models, as well as who will see your work and how it (and you) will be judged. It therefore behoves us all to be aware of journals' publishing policies, both for our own science and in our judgement of others. This is particularly important as the publishing landscape is changing rapidly, and as hiring and granting committees are trying to keep pace. 

We hope that the information we have compiled [2] will help make people make more informed decisions and judgements.

It is certainly true that some open-access journals (most notably, PLOS ONE) do not reject papers based on novelty or percieved impact. However, many open access journals are at least as selective as traditional print journals (e.g., eLife, PLOS Biology, Nature Communications, Table 1).
