#Open access is worth considering

##What's this?

This is a letter we sent to Trends in Plant Science in reponse to this letter from Anurag A. Agrawal:

##Why publish it in a closed access journal?

It might seem odd to have a letter about open access published in a closed-access journal, but I think it's important to engage with the whole community on these issues. Having these conversations in popular venues like the Trends journals seems like a good idea to me, because it allows us to reach an important audience for open access publishing - people who aren't yet convinced.

I reproduce the entire text here (and in the .docx and .pdf files), so that you can read it without paying to read the journal formatted version (of course, you are welcome to pay if you'd like to).

In a recent letter, Anurag A. Agrawal [1] outlines his opinions on open access (OA) publishing. In it, he incorrectly conflates OA journals with non-selective journals. Specifically, Agrawal [1] states that  "a publication in an open access journal only imparts [the information that it is] ‘not scientifically flawed'", and later that OA journals provide "no stamp of rigor or potential impact". Unfortunately this is a common misconception, and we would like to set the record straight: many OA journals are highly selective.

We compiled data on the publication policies and impact factors of 31 popular and reputable OA journals in biology (summarised in Table 1, full version with complete publication policies available at [2]). This list is far from exhaustive; it includes neither all of the popular and reputable OA journals, nor any of the many unpopular and/or irreputable ones [3]. Rather, the list comprises a small selection of journals that serves to demonstrate that many OA journals are both selective and high impact.

Our list reveals a diversity of publication policies, ranging from journals that aim to publish valid science regardless of novelty or likely impact (e.g. PLOS ONE, The PeerJ), to those that are at least as selective as the most competitive closed-access journals (e.g. PLOS Biology, BMC Biology, eLife). In total, 22 of the 31 journals in our list apply some kind of selection based on novelty and likely impact. Many OA journals also lead their fields based on metrics such as impact factors. For example, the 1st and 5th ranked journals in the Institute for Scientific Information’s (ISI) 'Biology' category are both OA (PLOS Biology and BMC Biology, with impact factors of 12.7 and 6.6 respectively), as is the 2nd ranked journal in ISI's 'Zoology' category (Frontiers in Zoology, impact factor 3.9).  In summary, a publication in an OA journal will often impart much more than the information that it is not flawed. And to the extent that impact factors can be used to estimate a publication's future citation rate [4], publications in many OA journals should be judged at least as favourably as those in closed access journals. 

We agree with Agrawal that researchers should carefully consider their options when deciding where to publish. The decision affects who will see the work, how it (and the researcher who produces it) will be judged, and the rise and fall of scientific publishing models. It is therefore essential that we are all aware of journals' publishing policies and reputations, both for our own science and in our judgement of others'. This is particularly important as hiring and granting committees try to keep pace with a rapidly changing publishing landscape.
